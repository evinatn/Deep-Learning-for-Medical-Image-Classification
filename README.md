### Project Overview
Radiologists often rely on chest X-rays to diagnose pulmonary diseases like pneumonia. This project aims to automate this process using deep learning. It's built as a comprehensive exploration of key deep learning concepts, including:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation.
- Building and training shallow and deep CNNs from scratch.
- Leveraging pretrained models for transfer learning.
- Interpreting model predictions using visualization techniques like Grad-CAM.

### Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset of chest X-ray images. The images are classified as either `Pneumonia` or `Normal`. The notebook details the steps for loading, preprocessing, and augmenting this image data for model training.

### Methodology
The `Deep_Learning_for_Medical_Image_Classification.ipynb` notebook systematically covers several approaches:

1. Data Preprocessing: Standardizing image sizes, normalization, and data augmentation to improve model generalization.
2. Shallow CNN: Implementation and training of a simple, custom-built convolutional neural network.
3. Deep CNN: Development of a more complex, multi-layered CNN to handle the intricacies of medical image data.
4. Transfer Learning: Utilizing a powerful, pre-trained model (like VGG or ResNet) as a feature extractor to achieve higher accuracy with less data.
5. Model Interpretability (Grad-CAM): Generating heatmaps to visualize which parts of an image the model focused on to make a prediction, providing insights into its decision-making process.
